# Notes

- The expanded scope seems to be working well in the account UI.
- There is a shift of focus to testing. This is a critical step and the testing cases must be of very high quality.
- Account finalization is stalled but this is not an issue. It is supplemental to the main functionality that is being finished presently.
- Implementation of the manual testing facilities is good to go and smooth.
